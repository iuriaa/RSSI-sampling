Collected using a wooden table and a wooden cube to have a distance from the ground.
The relative orientation was done by changing the orientation of the tablet and keeping the sensor fixed.
Contains 5 distances between 2.2m and 3.0m (every 0.2m) with 19 orientations each ranging from -90 to 90 (every 10°).
****DISCART ANY EXTRA SAMPLES****
Samples at the pose 2.4/80° need to be discarted. They were wrongly collected while the sensor was not positioned.
The sampling for the 2.4/80° pose can be found in a later collecting. (2016-05-13_05-53-22)
Rounding error on the distance was observed at 2.6(2.600001) and 2.8(2.800001). This is a software implementation issue and does not reflect ground thruth, ignore.
100 samples per pose. Total of 9400 samples.(minus 100 from discarted pose)
Executed in a home environment between 4:35AM and 5:45AM to avoid uncontrolled interference by other devices in the same building.
