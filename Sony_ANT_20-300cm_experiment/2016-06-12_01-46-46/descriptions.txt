Collected using a wooden table and a wooden cube to have a distance from the ground.
The relative orientation was done by changing the orientation of the tablet and keeping the sensor fixed.
Contains 15 distances between 0.2m and 3.0m (every 0.2m) with 19 orientations each ranging from -90 to 90 (every 10°).
****DISCART ANY EXTRA SAMPLES****
Samples at the pose 2.6/0° need to be discarted. They were wrongly collected while the sensor was not positioned.
A new sample set was done on the same day. It can be found under the folder 2016-06-12_05-26-59.
Rounding error on some distances were observed. This is a software implementation issue and does not reflect ground thruth, ignore.
100 samples per pose. Total of 28400 samples.(minus 100 from discarted pose)
Executed in a home environment between 1:45AM and 5:25AM to avoid uncontrolled interference by other devices in the same building.
